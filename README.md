# pandas-challenge
Module 4 Challenge

Google, askBCS, and students were used to help with this challenge. Despite all that, I could not get one code to work and it reverberated. 

If you have any valuable input on where that went wrong, that would be helpful.

My calculations have around a 50 point deduction for this, even all of the code following the error in the second dataframe is correct. 

Analysis is located at the top of the pandas file.
